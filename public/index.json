Specifically, a broken Jawa Babetta 210. Rather than trying to fix a broken 1978 engine that\u0026rsquo;s notoriously bad to begin with, I set out to do an electric conversion.\nDesign #\rMost of the mechanical components are still just cleaned up stock parts, only the drive system is modified. I just dropped in a motor bracket where the engine once was, attached the motor controller under the front of the frame, and attached a battery box holder where the fairings normally attach.\nMotor Mod #\rThe original motor was a heavy lift drone motor MITERS pulled out of a lake at one point. This was a great choice because, unlike most motors, it was free. Unfortunately, these types of motors arenâ€™t really intended for the kind of lateral forces caused by the chain.\nRather than attaching the sprocket to the far end of the motor as the motor was intended, and cantilevering the whole stack, I turned a replacement , longer shaft and pressed this in in place of the original;. This allowed me to attach a sprocket to the base instead.\nFront Sprocket #\rJawa 210 mopeds use a unique chain that has a 0.5in pitch, but unusually large rollers. The chain is not compatible with 415 sprockets, but 415 chain is more or less compatible with Jawa sprockets. I kept the original rear sprocket but replaced the chain and front sprocket with a 415 standard.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve cut internal keyways before and it\u0026rsquo;s just not an enjoyable process. When I can, I buy \u0026ldquo;weld-on keyed hubs\u0026rdquo;, which are bored cylinders with pre-cut keyways and set screws that I just weld to a flat sprocket. In this case, I just bought the sprocket, but less common sizes can be cut on a mill or waterjet and then ground to a taper.\nBattery #\rNothings too crazy here. Just a 20 series, 3 parallel set of LiFePo3 cells. Should do 150 amps continuously.\nBattery Box #\rOriginally, I welded up a steel box and mounted it to the frame. The idea was that I would be able to remove the discrete batteries from the top. However, the seat gets in the way.\nI whipped out my trusty angle grinder and hacked down the box. Then I fabbed an aluminum box from welded together MacBook cases. For the finishing touch, I added some canvas straps to hold everything together. Looks stylish, needs some decals.\nIn Action #\r","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/hosting-deployment/","section":"Projects","summary":"Table of Contents:\nIntroduction Design Motor Mod Front Sprocket Battery Battery Box In Action Introduction #\rIn a fit of boredom while writing my thesis, I bought a moped.

I grew up in California, where there is no snow. But I also grew up surrounded on three sides by field and know the value of off-road vehicles. Regardless, I really like putting tracks and large-travel suspension on things that probably donâ€™t need them. The result is the Snowtercycle. Snow + Motorcycle = Snowtercycle\nDesign #\rWell, itâ€™s a motorcycle with tracks. Full suspension. Electric.\nFront Suspension #\rIâ€™m using an older form of suspension, leading link suspension. Rather than relying on telescoping tubes, leading links use steel linkages and standard shock absorbers. This suspension is more resistant to corrosion because there is no need for perfectly smooth, rust free, telescoping tubes. The suspension rises while braking, instead of collapsing and limiting travel like a more traditional suspension.\nLots of interesting fixturing and machining operations to make the leading link suspension. The tubes were coped (cut to mate up nearly perfectly with the other tubes) on the bridgeport mill.\nIâ€™m very happy with the welding. Apparently Iâ€™ve still got it.\nTriple Clamp #\rCNC machined from aluminum. Itâ€™s not bad, but I need to move the tubes further forwards and increase the size to cover the head tube and prevent water incursion into the bearings.\nMassive thrust bearings just because theyâ€™re what I had around. Bearing races press fit into the head tube.\nThe bottom triple clamp is press fit around the fork axle and bolted tight.\nElectronics #\rKelly KLS-N Sinusoidal motor controller (72v 350A) running a Motenergy ME0907 motor (100 A continuous). Thatâ€™s about 6 hp continous, peaking at about 15 hp.\nIâ€™d like to enclose the control panel at some point, but for now itâ€™s suitably clicky with lots of gauges.\nIn Action #\rSounds like a two stroke and its pretty bumpy on the road. Looking forward to the snow.\n","date":"24 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/hosting-deployment/","section":"Projects","summary":"Table of Contents:\nIntroduction Design Front Suspension Triple Clamp Electronics In Action Introduction #\rMITERS has a long tradition of building scooters and road vehicles that fail quickly once the first snow falls in Boston.","title":"Snowtercycle","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/electric/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Electric","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/electric-vehicle/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Electric Vehicle","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/exampletag2/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Exampletag2","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/exampletagone/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Exampletagone","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/motor/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Motor","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rA more in-depth look at some of my work\r","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"\rA more in-depth look at some of my work\r","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"\rThis is a demo of the background layout.\rSwitch layout \u0026orarr;\rnpx blowfish-tools ","date":"25 January 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Welcome to Blowfish! ðŸŽ‰","summary":"\rThis is a demo of the background layout.\rSwitch layout \u0026orarr;\rnpx blowfish-tools ","title":"Welcome to Blowfish! ðŸŽ‰","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"24 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/ev/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"EV","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"24 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/snow/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Snow","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
